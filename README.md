**Project Guidelines & Best Practices**

This Rider Taxi Django app provides data about rides. Each ride includes information about the passenger, the driver, and event notes, which will be enhanced in future updates.

This document outlines key guidelines and best practices for working on this project. Following these ensures clean, maintainable, and optimized code.

**Migrations**
- Always review migration files to understand what and why changes have been applied.
- Take extra caution when squashing migrations to avoid data loss or inconsistencies.

**Admin Interface**
- An admin has been created to help facilitate creating, updating, and viewing objects.
- You may customize data column display, filters, and object string representations to improve readability.

**Models**
- Implement _**on_delete=models.CASCADE**_ where appropriate. For example, rides should be deleted if a user is deleted. This is to ensure we have clean data.
- Ensure only authorized users can delete critical objects like users.

**API Security**
- Add safeguards in API access if need be, such as notifying admin users via email on unauthorized access attempts.
- Use clean and consistent logging practices throughout the codebase.

**Utilities & Reusability**
- Keep reusable functions like storing functions in utils.py to maintain clean and DRY code.

**Database Optimization**
- Optimize database queries wherever possible to ensure efficiency.

**API List Pagination**
- Pagination is already handled in REST_FRAMEWORK settings.

**Coding Style**
- Minimize comments; write clean, self-explanatory code.
